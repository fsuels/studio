## How these improvements increase protection and conversion

- **No guarantees, no "court-approved" claims** → avoids UPL and FTC issues
- **Plain-language, benefit-led phrasing** → builds trust without sounding legalistic
- **Strategic social-proof and value anchors** → nudges hesitant buyers
- **Optional attorney-review upsell** keeps disclaimers honest yet offers reassurance
