# 🎯 AI Document Discovery Quick Wins - Validation Guide

## ✅ IMPLEMENTED FIXES

### 1. **Category Veto Rules** (COMPLETED)
- **Problem**: "Getting divorce" returned "Articles of Incorporation" as #1
- **Fix**: Hard-coded veto rules block obviously wrong categories
- **Logic**: 
  ```typescript
  divorce queries → block: business-formation, corporation, llc, vehicle, farm, mining
  vehicle queries → block: family-law, divorce, marriage, business-formation  
  business queries → block: family-law, divorce, vehicle-sales
  ```

### 2. **Cluster Chips for Generic Queries** (COMPLETED) 
- **Problem**: Queries like "contract" or "agreement" returned random results
- **Fix**: Show category chips instead of confusing results
- **Triggers**: "contract", "agreement", "document", "form", "template"
- **Shows**: 8 category buttons (Business, Employment, Real Estate, Family, Vehicle, Service, Legal Action, Confidential)

### 3. **Enhanced Divorce Detection** (COMPLETED)
- **Problem**: Misspellings like "divorve" not detected
- **Fix**: Multiple detection patterns
- **Handles**: "divorce", "divorc", "divorve", "separat", "separation"
- **Boost**: +500 points for perfect divorce matches

## 🔍 DEBUGGING 

### Console Logs Added:
- `🚫 VETO: "Document Name" blocked for divorce query`
- `🔍 Query: "divorce" | Original: 15 results | After Veto: 3 results`

### What to Look For:
1. **Veto Rules Working**: Console shows blocked documents
2. **Result Count Drop**: Original results > After veto results for specific queries
3. **Cluster Chips**: Generic queries show chips instead of documents
4. **No More 91% Everything**: Better confidence calibration
