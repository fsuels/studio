# 🏥 Document Quality Verification System

A comprehensive quality assurance system to prevent document quality issues and maintain system integrity.

## 🎯 Overview

This system provides automated quality checks, monitoring, and prevention tools to ensure your legal document platform maintains the highest standards.

## 🔧 Components

### 1. Quality Verification System

**File:** `scripts/quality-verification-system.js`

Comprehensive automated checks including:

- ✅ Document structure integrity
- ✅ Export consistency validation
- ✅ Template completeness verification
- ✅ Metadata validation
- ✅ Schema validation
- ✅ Component integration checks
- ✅ TypeScript compilation
- ✅ Code linting

**Usage:**

```bash
npm run quality-check
```

**Quality Score:** Generates a score from 0-100 based on:

- Critical errors (2x penalty)
- Warnings (0.5x penalty)
- Overall system health

### 2. Pre-Commit Hooks

**File:** `.husky/pre-commit`

Automatically runs quality checks before every commit:

- 🔍 Document quality verification
- 🔍 Template verification
- 🔍 TypeScript compilation
- 🔍 Code linting

**Prevents commits when:**

- Critical errors found
- TypeScript compilation fails
- Template verification fails

### 3. CI/CD Pipeline

**File:** `.github/workflows/document-quality-check.yml`

Automated checks on every push/PR:

- 🚀 Runs on push to main/master/develop
- 🚀 Runs on pull requests
- 🚀 Daily scheduled runs at 2 AM UTC
- 📊 Generates quality reports
- 💬 Comments on PRs with quality results
- ❌ Fails builds on critical issues

### 4. Monitoring Dashboard

**File:** `scripts/monitoring-dashboard.js`

Real-time health monitoring:

- 📈 Live quality score tracking
- 📊 Issues trend analysis
- 🚨 Active alerts system
- 📋 System statistics
- 🔄 Auto-refresh every minute

**Usage:**

```bash
npm run monitor
```

**Access:** http://localhost:3001

### 5. Automated Testing

**File:** `tests/document-generation.test.ts`

Comprehensive test suite covering:

- 📋 Document library integrity
- 🔍 Schema validation
- ❓ Questions configuration
- 📄 Template path validation
- ⚙️ Document generation flow
- 🏷️ Category organization
- 🔍 Search and aliases
- ⚡ Performance optimization
- 🔗 Integration points

## 📊 Quality Metrics

### Quality Score Calculation

```
Score = 100 - ((Errors × 2 + Warnings × 0.5) / Total Checks) × 100
```

### Health Status Levels

- 🎉 **Excellent** (95-100): Outstanding quality
- ✅ **Good** (85-94): Solid quality
- ⚠️ **Fair** (70-84): Needs improvement
- 🚨 **Critical** (<70): Immediate attention required

### Alert Thresholds

- **Quality Score:** < 85
- **Error Count:** > 5
- **Warning Count:** > 20
- **Document Count:** < 45

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Initial Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm ci

# Run initial quality check
npm run quality-check

# Start monitoring dashboard
npm run monitor
```

### 2. Development Workflow

```bash
# Before making changes
npm run quality-check

# Make your changes...

# Verify quality before commit
npm run quality-check

# Commit (pre-commit hooks will run automatically)
git commit -m "Your changes"
```

### 3. Monitoring

```bash
# Start dashboard for continuous monitoring
npm run monitor

# View dashboard at http://localhost:3001
# API endpoints:
# - /api/metrics - JSON metrics
# - /api/health - Health check
```

## 📋 Quality Reports

### Generated Reports

- **Location:** `quality-reports/`
- **Format:** JSON with timestamp
- **Retention:** Configurable (default: 30 days in CI)

### Report Structure

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",
  "summary": {
    "totalDocuments": 49,
    "passedChecks": 245,
    "failedChecks": 0,
    "warningChecks": 3
  },
  "score": 98.5,
  "errors": [],
  "warnings": [...],
  "recommendations": [...]
}
```

## 🔧 Configuration

### Quality Thresholds

Edit `scripts/quality-verification-system.js`:

```javascript
const thresholds = {
  qualityScore: 85,
  errorCount: 5,
  warningCount: 20,
  documentCount: 45,
};
```

### Monitoring Settings

Edit `scripts/monitoring-dashboard.js`:

```javascript
const config = {
  port: 3001,
  refreshInterval: 60000, // 1 minute
  historyRetention: 24 * 60, // 24 hours
  thresholds: { ... }
};
```
