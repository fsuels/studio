```\r\n`\r\n## Shared Active Risks
- Spanish metadata and policy translations remain outstanding; English versions published but localization and parity checks pending.
- CSP telemetry escalation path still depends on external webhook uptime; alert observability needed.
- Duplicate middleware and Next.js config files risk drift in routing and security behaviour.
- Incident response playbook undeveloped; communication templates and rehearsal schedule still missing.
- Release gate checklist adoption pending; need automated evidence collection from Platform, Growth, and Payments.
- Jurisdiction knowledge base incomplete (only CA plus general data); nationwide coverage mandate unmet.
- International launch claims lack supporting legal research; GDPR transfer safeguards undefined.\r\n`\r\n## Cross-Pod Follow-Ups
1. Platform -> Compliance: Validate security header rollout plan against legal requirements and align CSP escalation policy with new telemetry.
2. Platform: Persist CSP reports to durable store with alerting pipeline.
3. Platform -> Compliance: Draft incident communication playbook aligned with legal obligations.
4. Compliance -> Platform: Link policy pages in product UI and automate release gate evidence uploads.
5. Compliance -> Growth: Update marketing assets to reflect new policies and bilingual messaging.
6. Compliance -> DocumentIntelligence: Provide statutory citations and localization guidance for Spanish policy translations.
7. Compliance -> Payments: Align checkout receipts and support scripts with refund policy terms.
8. DocumentIntelligence -> Platform: Confirm overlay ingestion and field map deployment once mappings are backfilled.
9. Compliance -> DocumentIntelligence: Review updated prenuptial/service/quitclaim flows for legal approvals.\r\n`\r\n## Growth Cycle (growth-cycle-0003)
