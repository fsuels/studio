# AI & Automation Cycle 0002 - OSS Migration Summary

## Highlights
- Expanded `TEAM/AI-Automation/AI-Automation.md` with replacement roadmap, architecture diagram narrative, safety plan, and operating cadence updates.
- Documented OSS substitutions for proprietary dependencies and detailed phased rollout covering gateway, guardrails, and observability.
- Captured open dependencies on Compliance, Platform, and SRE for secret management, refusal taxonomy, and GPU operations.

## Verification
- Manual review of updated playbook for ASCII compliance and removal of control characters.
- Cross-checked current state items against `src/ai` stubs to ensure accuracy.

## Follow-Ups
- Publish LiteLLM deployment checklist including `/health` probe contract and quota configuration once infrastructure work begins.
- Draft evaluation harness job specs (lm-evaluation-harness and Ragas) aligned with EN/ES gold sets.
- Schedule compliance review for refusal taxonomy and bilingual disclaimers before re-enabling intake flows.
