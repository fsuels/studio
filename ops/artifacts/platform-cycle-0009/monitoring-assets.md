# CSP Monitoring Assets Validation - platform-cycle-0009

## Summary
- Added Grafana dashboard template (`ops/monitoring/csp-alert-dashboard.json`) for CSP alert visualization.
- Authored Prometheus alert rule pack (`ops/monitoring/csp-alert-prometheus-rules.yaml`) aligned with the CSP runbook.
- Updated SRE runbook with monitoring asset references to streamline rollout.

## Verification
- Validated dashboard JSON structure via static linting; ready for Grafana import.
- Prometheus rules pass YAML syntax review and mirror queries documented in the runbook.
- Runbook now references both dashboard and rule assets for quick SRE onboarding.
