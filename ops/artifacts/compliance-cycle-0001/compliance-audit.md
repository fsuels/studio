# Compliance Cycle 0001 Audit

## Overview
- Scope: policy freshness, jurisdiction knowledge base, release gate coverage, legal incident logging, international readiness.
- References: TEAM/Compliance-Legal/Compliance-Legal.md charter; AGENT.md guardrails on UPL, privacy, and deceptive marketing.

## Policy Freshness
- public/templates/en/privacy-policy.md and public/templates/en/website-terms-of-service.md are single-line placeholders with encoding artifacts ("Ac 2025 123LegalDoc ..."), providing no substantive disclosures; violates FTC Act Section 5 transparency expectations and fails ABA Model Rule 5.5 safe-harbor messaging.
- No dedicated disclaimer or refund policy markdown exists in public/ or docs/; refund commitments required under state consumer protection statutes (for example, Cal. Civ. Code Section 1723) are absent.
- Spanish templates mirror English placeholders, so bilingual coverage mandated by mission is non-functional.

## Jurisdiction Knowledge Base
- Only legal-requirements/general-requirements.json and legal-requirements/CA-requirements.json exist; 49 states plus territories missing despite the 90-day objective for full U.S. coverage.
- California entry lastUpdated is 2024-01-01, predating 2025 legislative updates such as recent CCPA amendments, risking stale guidance.

## Release Gate Coverage
- No compliance checklist or sign-off artifacts in ops/ besides ops/artifacts/platform-cycle-0001/platform-audit.md, which already flags the missing process.
- Release train still lacks UPL, privacy, and marketing gates; contravenes playbook requirements and exposes launches to unauthorized practice and privacy violations (for example, CCPA Section 1798.100, GDPR Article 5).

## Legal Incident Logs
- Repository search revealed no dedicated legal incident log, hotline register, or regulatory inquiry tracker under ops/, alerts/, or compliance-reports/.
- Without logging, incident response SLA targets (acknowledge within 1 business day) in the playbook are unenforceable.

## International Readiness
- Numerous strategic docs tout global readiness, yet no jurisdictional dossiers, translation QA, or export controls checklist exist; GDPR Article 44 transfer safeguards are unaccounted for.
- Market readiness scripts reference automation but lack legal source data, leaving international launch gating incomplete.

## Recommended Next Steps
1. Draft and publish disclaimer, ToS, privacy, and refund markdown with counsel review; localize to Spanish simultaneously.
2. Build a U.S. jurisdiction tracker covering update cadence, citations, and mandatory notices; prioritize high-change states (CA, NY, TX, FL).
3. Author a compliance release gate checklist and store signed approvals per release in ops/artifacts/<cycle_id>/.
4. Stand up a central legal incident log with intake fields (date, source, severity, resolution) and align with the incident response playbook.
5. Define an international expansion readiness SOP covering data transfer impact assessments, localization, and export compliance.
