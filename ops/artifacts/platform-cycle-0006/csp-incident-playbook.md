# CSP Incident Response Playbook - platform-cycle-0006

## Summary
- Authored `docs/runbooks/csp-incident-playbook.md` outlining detection, containment, communication, and follow-up steps for high/critical CSP violations.
- Defined trigger criteria tied to new alert metadata (`alertDelivered`, webhook failure reasons).
- Documented roles, severity classification, evidence capture, and post-incident metrics expectations.

## Next Steps
- Coordinate with SRE to provision webhook staging and integrate metrics.
- Align Compliance review for customer comms templates referenced in the playbook.

## Verification
- Reviewed playbook content and ensured references to existing artifacts (security_csp_reports, postmortem template) align with repository structure.
