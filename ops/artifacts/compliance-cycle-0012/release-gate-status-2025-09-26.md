## Summary
Release gate adoption remains at risk ahead of the 2025-09-26 freeze. Spanish policy translations and cookie banner evidence are the critical blockers for CCPA Section 1798.130(a)(2) compliance and DSAR verification. Cross-pod coordination with Platform, Growth, and Payments is required to unlock sign-offs.

## Checklist Status Snapshot
| Section | Status | Evidence / References | Owners | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| UPL Safeguards | At Risk | docs/legal/disclaimer.md; ops/artifacts/compliance-cycle-0012/spanish-policy-localization-status.md | Compliance, Platform | Spanish disclaimer pending; footer/UI links not yet localized per ops/compliance/bilingual-policy-rollout-checklist.md. |
| Privacy & Data Protection | Blocked | docs/legal/privacy-notice.md; ops/artifacts/compliance-cycle-0010/dsar-dry-run-prep.md | Compliance, Platform | Cookie consent telemetry export outstanding; DSAR dry run scheduled but lacks bilingual acknowledgment template. |
| Marketing & Claims Review | At Risk | docs/legal/terms-of-service.md; docs/legal/refund-policy.md | Compliance, Growth | Awaiting Spanish copy to align marketing funnels; Growth review log not created. |
| Payments & Refund Compliance | Blocked | docs/legal/refund-policy.md | Compliance, Payments | Refund SOP still tied to mocked Stripe; need terms alignment once translations arrive. |
| Security & Incident Readiness | In Progress | ops/compliance/legal-incident-log.md; ops/compliance/legal-incident-contacts.md | Compliance, Platform | Contact roster ready; need CSP telemetry export and on-call tool integration proof. |
| Cross-Pod Sign-Offs | Not Started | ops/compliance/release-gate-checklist.md | All Pods | No signatures captured; waiting on blockers clearance. |
| Artifact Upload | Not Started | ops/artifacts/compliance-cycle-XXXX/ | Compliance | Need final bilingual evidence package and signed checklist for archive. |

## Critical Blocking Items
- **Spanish policy delivery (Compliance <-> Redwood Legal LLP):** confirm translator acceptance and generate docs/legal/es/* to satisfy CCPA bilingual notice requirements.
- **Cookie banner telemetry (Platform):** export consent logs and attach to DSAR dry run evidence to document GDPR/CCPA compliance.
- **Refund SOP alignment (Payments):** finalize production flow guidance with translations to meet California Civil Code Section 1723 expectations.

## Required Evidence Before Freeze
- Bilingual policy markdown + PDFs with hashes (store under docs/legal/es/ and translation approvals directory).
- Cookie banner verification artifact with timestamped telemetry and screenshots.
- DSAR dry run completion package (acknowledgment, exports, hashes, deletion logs).
- Cross-pod sign-off table populated with names, dates, and notes.

## Immediate Actions
1. Compliance: follow up with Redwood Legal LLP on translation receipt by 2025-09-20 and update translation approval log.
2. Platform: schedule consent telemetry export walkthrough before DSAR dry run (reference ops/artifacts/compliance-cycle-0010/dsar-dry-run-prep.md Step 2).
3. Compliance + Payments: draft refund SOP alignment note outlining translation dependencies and evidence expectations for release gate submission.
