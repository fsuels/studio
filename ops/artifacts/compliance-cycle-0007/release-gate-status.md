| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1. UPL Safeguards | In Progress | Updated state knowledge base entries for Colorado and Georgia (ops/compliance/jurisdiction-us-baseline.md). | Document Intelligence to add Colorado and Georgia statutory warnings and filing guidance to workflows; Platform to surface new disclaimers in UI. |
| 2. Privacy & Data Protection | Blocked pending DSAR evidence | Newly published DSAR SOP (ops/compliance/dsar-sop.md) sets process; awaiting first ticket artifacts under ops/artifacts/compliance-cycle-0007/privacy-evidence/. | Platform to provide consent telemetry export; Compliance to execute first DSAR dry run and populate evidence folder before 2025-09-25. |
| 3. Marketing & Claims | In Progress | SignWell analytics review (ops/artifacts/growth-cycle-0002/signwell-analytics-report.md) remains latest; no Colorado/Georgia messaging yet. | Growth to update marketing copy with Colorado and Georgia disclaimers; Compliance to review translations once Growth provides drafts. |

## Privacy Evidence Tracker
- Created directory placeholder: ops/artifacts/compliance-cycle-0007/privacy-evidence/ *(empty pending DSAR dry run)*.
- Next step: run DSAR tabletop using SOP and document outputs (cover letter, data package) before freeze.

## Cross-Pod Follow-Ups
1. **Platform**: deliver consent telemetry export and integrate DSAR SOP checkpoints into on-call runbook.
2. **Document Intelligence**: map Colorado and Georgia statutory warnings and witness requirements into template metadata, provide ETA for deployment.
3. **Growth**: update marketing footers and policy callouts for Colorado and Georgia; share bilingual copy for compliance review.
4. **Payments**: provide refund SOP alignment for Colorado and Georgia, including written response timelines.
5. **AI**: confirm intake assistant refuses Colorado- and Georgia-specific legal advice consistent with new disclaimers once deployed.

## Upcoming Deadlines
- 2025-09-22: Weekly release freeze; gate requires evidence for Sections 1-3 at minimum.
- 2025-09-25: Target date for DSAR evidence package and cookie banner telemetry (per ops/compliance/dsar-cookie-verification.md).
- 2025-09-26: Release gate sign-offs due for all pods before freeze lifts.

## Notes
- Remember.md pending cross-pod tasks already list several items; additions noted above should be routed through CEO handoff rather than direct edits.
- Store SHA256 checksums for all new artifacts in ops/artifacts/compliance-cycle-0007/checksums.json once evidence populated.
