# Advance Directive Template Refresh (document-intel-cycle-0008)

## Overview
- Replaced placeholder content for the advance directive template with a production-ready form exceeding 500 words and 39 structured variables.
- Delivered bilingual parity by authoring a Spanish localization aligned section-by-section with the English source.
- Embedded consistent signatures, notary acknowledgement, and jurisdiction placeholders to support overlay, question routing, and compliance review.

## Key Enhancements
1. **Structured Sections:** Added numbered clauses covering agent appointments, life-sustaining treatment, mental health directives, HIPAA authorization, and revocation mechanics.
2. **Expanded Variables:** Introduced 39 handlebars fields spanning identity, contact, medical preferences, and notary details to drive dynamic document assembly.
3. **Execution Formalities:** Included witness attestations, notary block, and explicit guidance for providers when the directive activates.
4. **Compliance Copy:** Clarified non-legal-advice disclaimer and highlighted state-specific counseling to satisfy UPL guardrails.

## Localization Notes
- Spanish version mirrors every section and variable, retaining shared identifiers for schema/question reuse.
- Terminology leverages compliant phrases ("Persona Otorgante", "Representante", "Autorizaci√≥n HIPAA") to align with policy glossary guidance.
- Ready for Compliance linguistic QA alongside forthcoming jurisdictional inserts (e.g., WA addenda).

## Next Steps
- Update question flows to prefill new pregnancy, organ donation, and guardian directives fields.
- Coordinate overlay mapping for jurisdictions requiring notarized acknowledgement and witness affidavits.
- Regenerate placeholder audit to capture additional high-priority templates needing conversion (e.g., accident-report, ach-authorization-form).
