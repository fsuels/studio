# Security Header & CSP Telemetry Validation - platform-cycle-0007

## Middleware Coverage Checks
- Verified locale redirects now include CSP report-only, Report-To, and permissions headers.
- Confirmed admin redirect (unauthenticated) issues security headers before returning 307.
- Ensured tenant rewrites preserve Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only when tenant middleware rewrites request paths.

## CSP Alert Telemetry
- Added structured metric recorder emitting console evidence plus security audit logs.
- Verified skipped, delivered, and failure pathways produce metric snapshots with reasons and webhook configuration flags.

## Test Evidence
- npm run test -- __tests__/middleware/security-headers.test.ts src/lib/security/__tests__/csp-alerts.test.ts --runInBand
- Test console trace stored in jest-results.txt within this artifact directory.
