- **Cycle**: compliance-cycle-0005
- **Checklist Reference**: ops/compliance/release-gate-checklist.md
- **Release Window**: 2025-09-22 through 2025-09-26
- **Goal**: Drive full pod adoption of the compliance release gate ahead of public launch.

## Summary
- UPL safeguards and policy links review are partially complete; awaiting Platform wiring in product surfaces.
- Privacy impact inputs need DSAR workflow documentation and cookie banner verification once Platform finalizes telemetry.
- Marketing copy review requires Growth pod to align bilingual messaging with policy language now that policy freshness audit is logged.
- Payments refund alignment depends on production Stripe flow and receipt template updates.
- Incident readiness improved with roster and log templates, but on-call tooling integration remains open.
