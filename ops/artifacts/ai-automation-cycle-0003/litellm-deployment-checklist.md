# AI & Automation Cycle 0003 - LiteLLM Deployment Checklist

## Highlights
- Authored `ops/runbooks/litellm-deployment-checklist.md` covering prerequisites, configuration templates, guardrail chain, observability, and compliance gates for LiteLLM + vLLM rollout.
- Documented secret manager usage, health checks, autoscaling, and evaluation gates to align with AI & Automation playbook objectives.
- Captured incident response triggers and validation checklist for Platform/SRE handoff.

## Verification
- Manual lint for ASCII-only content and adherence to runbook format used in `ops/runbooks/csp-alert-prometheus.md`.

## Follow-Ups
- Coordinate with Platform to translate the configuration template into Helm/kustomize manifests.
