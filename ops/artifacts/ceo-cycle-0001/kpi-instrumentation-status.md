# KPI Instrumentation Status - ceo-cycle-0001
reported_at: 2025-09-19T16:37:47.2097818Z

## Summary
- Week 1 deliverables (due 2025-09-26) remain at-risk: GA4 ingestion and Lighthouse/axe pipelines are not yet implemented; Platform still needs webhook staging and alert metrics.
- Growth completed SignWell event instrumentation and a marketing SEO audit, but GA4 ingestion and translation catalog work are outstanding for KPI dashboards.
- Payments improved webhook security, yet production Stripe flows, telemetry storage, and dashboard modeling are still pending.
- Compliance published policies but must localize Spanish content and align telemetry checkpoints before KPI reporting can begin.
- Document Intelligence added overlay stubs but manual mapping is required before Platform can automate template ingestion metrics.

## Week 1 Deliverables (Due 2025-09-26)
| Deliverable | Owner(s) | Status | Evidence | Risks / Blockers |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GA4 / warehouse ingestion for signwell_cta_click & signwell_disclaimer_view | Platform, Growth | At Risk | Growth events ready (ops/artifacts/growth-cycle-0002/signwell-analytics-report.md) but Platform GA4 ingestion not implemented (Memory.md: growth-cycle-0002 follow-up) | GA4 property access & ingestion endpoint missing; funnel API still mocks data (src/app/api/analytics/funnel/route.ts). |
| Lighthouse CI & axe automated runs | Platform | At Risk | No artifacts recorded; Platform to-dos focus on CSP webhook staging (TEAM/Platform-Engineering/memory.json). | Need CI integration and metrics pipeline before KPI extraction; competing CSP alerting work. |
| Stripe telemetry data model approval | Payments | At Risk | Webhook signature verification now implemented (src/lib/stripe-integration.ts); data model not delivered. | Production Stripe integration still mocked; requires coordination with Compliance on refund policy evidence. |

## Week 2 Deliverables (Due 2025-10-03)
| Deliverable | Owner(s) | Prerequisites | Current Readiness |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CWV & Accessibility dashboards (Looker/Metabase) | Platform, Compliance | Week 1 Lighthouse/axe automation | Not started; dependent on Week 1 instrumentation. |
| SEO coverage auto-report (canonical/hreflang/jsonld) | Growth, Platform | GA4 ingestion optional, needs site scanner | Growth cycle 0003 audit exists, but automation script not yet written. |
| Payments success/refund metrics via webhooks | Payments, Compliance | Production Stripe integration; durable storage | Webhook signature ready; success metrics not yet logged. |

## Week 3 Deliverables (Due 2025-10-10)
| Deliverable | Owner(s) | Prerequisites | Current Readiness |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Wizard funnel metrics from GA4/warehouse | Growth, Platform | Week 1 GA4 ingestion | Not started; funnel API still returns mock data. |
| Customer outcome dashboard (wizard?purchase, AOV, NPS) | Growth, Payments, Compliance | GA4 + Stripe telemetry; NPS tooling | Not started. |
| Automated weekly KPI roll-up notebook | CEO Pod | All upstream dashboards live | Not started; blocked on instrumentation. |

## Pod Notes
- **Platform Engineering**: CSP telemetry pipeline extended; needs GA4 ingestion, Lighthouse/axe automation, webhook staging, and alert metrics (TEAM/Platform-Engineering/memory.json).
- **Growth**: SignWell events instrumented; GA draft audit shipped (ops/artifacts/growth-cycle-0003/marketing-seo-audit.md); awaiting GA4 ingestion and translation catalog plan (TEAM/Growth-Customer-Learning/memory.json).
- **Payments**: Webhook verification added; still lacks production Stripe flows and telemetry storage schema (TEAM/Payments-Monetization/memory.json).
- **Document Intelligence**: Overlay stubs published for Colorado POA and Georgia T-7; manual mapping required to unblock Platform ingestion metrics (TEAM/Document-Intelligence/memory.json, ops/artifacts/document-intel-cycle-0004/overlay-audit.json).
- **Compliance**: Policy stack live but localization and telemetry checkpoints outstanding; incident roster documented (TEAM/Compliance-Legal/memory.json).
- **AI & Automation**: Gateway abstraction deployed; guardrail/evaluation telemetry still missing (TEAM/AI-Automation/memory.json).

## Immediate Follow-Ups
1. Platform to provide GA4 ingestion plan (schema, storage, schedule) and confirm webhook staging URL by 2025-09-23.
2. Growth to share event taxonomy document covering wizard steps and marketing routes by 2025-09-23.
3. Payments to outline Stripe integration rollout (client/server/webhook) with required secrets inventory and PCI checklist by 2025-09-26.
4. Document Intelligence to coordinate with Platform on manual overlay tooling decision for Colorado POA and Georgia T-7 by 2025-09-24.
5. Compliance to deliver Spanish policy localization schedule and telemetry evidence workflow by 2025-09-24.
