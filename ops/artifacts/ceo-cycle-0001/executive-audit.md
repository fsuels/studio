# Executive Audit - ceo-cycle-0001
executed_at: 2025-09-19T15:50:12Z

## Platform Engineering
- Status: Firestore CSP logging landed; security headers still report-only with duplicated middleware (TEAM/Platform-Engineering/memory.json).
- Risks & Blockers: No alerting pipeline for telemetry; duplicated middleware risks inconsistent enforcement; incident comms playbook absent.
- KPI Impact: Threatens platform health targets (uptime/MTTR) if incidents lack alerting or comms; ties directly to backlog item Deploy end-to-end security header stack.
- Upcoming Milestones: Need durable telemetry + incident playbook before security header enforcement per REMEMBER backlog and Q2 reliability commitments.

## Document Intelligence
- Status: Schema/question backlog cleared for key agreements; Spanish metadata and overlay mapping gaps remain (TEAM/Document-Intelligence/memory.json).
- Risks & Blockers: 19 Spanish metadata TODOs and missing overlay maps threaten template parity KPI and 99% parity NSO.
- KPI Impact: Directly affects Legal Accuracy and Template Parity metrics; delays hinder Q2 parity milestone.
- Upcoming Milestones: Localize metadata, expand placeholder registry, coordinate compliance review (REMEMBER backlog: Spanish metadata localization & overlay reduction).

## AI & Automation
- Status: No active cycle; evaluation harness and guardrail telemetry absent (TEAM/AI-Automation/memory.json).
- Risks & Blockers: Lack of bilingual guardrails jeopardizes compliance defect rate and intake assistant promise.
- KPI Impact: Impacts Customer Outcome conversion (wizard guidance) and Compliance defect metrics.
- Upcoming Milestones: Need evaluation harness + refusal taxonomy per backlog (REMEMBER AI item) before intake assistant beta.

## Compliance & Legal Ops
- Status: Baseline audits captured; policies still placeholders; release gate adoption pending (TEAM/Compliance-Legal/memory.json).
- Risks & Blockers: Missing policies, incomplete jurisdiction knowledge base, and unassigned incident contacts expose UPL and FTC risks.
- KPI Impact: Drives compliance defect rate >1% if unresolved; blocks Q2 milestone for automated compliance regression.
- Upcoming Milestones: Draft bilingual policies, enforce release gate, expand jurisdiction tracker (REMEMBER backlog compliance item).

## Growth & Customer Learning
- Status: SignWell page updated with canonical/hreflang; telemetry and translation systems still mocked/manual (TEAM/Growth-Customer-Learning/memory.json).
- Risks & Blockers: Funnel metrics unreliable; translation catalogs missing; campaigns waiting on compliance copy.
- KPI Impact: Blocks SEO coverage KPIs, and wizard-to-purchase conversion measurement.
- Upcoming Milestones: Stand up GA4/warehouse telemetry, create translation catalogs, obtain compliance copy approvals (REMEMBER growth backlog item).

## Payments & Monetization
- Status: Baseline audit flagged mocked Stripe integrations; no production flows yet (TEAM/Payments-Monetization/memory.json).
- Risks & Blockers: Mocked Stripe + absent refund policy block revenue launch and PCI readiness.
- KPI Impact: Prevents Payments KPI (MRR, success rate) progress; delays Q2 milestone for production payments.
- Upcoming Milestones: Implement production Stripe client/server, webhooks, and refund SOP aligned with compliance (REMEMBER payments backlog item).

## CEO Office
- Status: No prior cycle; cross-pod dependencies tracked in Remember.md; metrics baselines mostly empty.
- Risks & Blockers: Without coordinated follow-through, pods stall on compliance, telemetry, and localization tasks; need metrics instrumentation plan.
- KPI Impact: All NSOs depend on unblocking cross-pod actions; absence of metrics prevents KPI tracking.
- Upcoming Milestones: Set cycle ownership rotation, drive backlog prioritization, define instrumentation roadmap.

## Cross-Pod Highlights
- Compliance dependencies block Platform (security headers), Growth (copy approval), Payments (refund policy), and Document Intelligence (jurisdiction reviews).
- Platform telemetry + incident playbook prerequisite for Growth analytics and Compliance enforcement.
- AI guardrails need Document Intelligence data and Compliance taxonomy alignment before deployment.
