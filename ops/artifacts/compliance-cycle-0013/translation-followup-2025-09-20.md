Subject: Follow-Up: Spanish Policy Translation Request - 123LegalDoc

Hello Maria,

Thank you again for reviewing our policy translation packet. We wanted to confirm that Redwood Legal LLP can deliver certified Spanish translations for the following by 2025-09-24:
- docs/legal/disclaimer.md (hash D70C37A143C4460E51DD5A339860C72BDC004B5B5A48FD366A25068E67EDBA6F)
- docs/legal/terms-of-service.md (hash 93CD66DCBD30D1815A0CC1487A1FB208C4AF0E5C1862BD31DA8106174D5A55FE)
- docs/legal/privacy-notice.md (hash 16E326597981B51BCECA745CBD869D3E0B4028AB3367F67C761D8174E201E44D)
- docs/legal/refund-policy.md (hash 91976662AB05C40480CF253C25543EE5C20ADFA0F069035CC624E088DD6BFCCF)

Please confirm receipt, delivery feasibility, and whether you need any additional materials. We included the terminology glossary (ops/compliance/policy-glossary-es.json) and will store your certification letter under ops/artifacts/compliance-cycle-0009/translation-approvals/.

These translations unlock our compliance release gate obligations for CCPA Section 1798.130(a)(2) bilingual notices and ABA Model Rule 5.5 disclosures. If the 2025-09-24 target is at risk, let us know by 2025-09-20 so we can engage an alternate certified vendor per ops/compliance/translation-vendors.md.

Thank you!
