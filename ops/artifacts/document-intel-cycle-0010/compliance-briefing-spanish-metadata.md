# Compliance Briefing: Spanish Metadata & Execution Formalities

- **Cycle**: document-intel-cycle-0010
- **Prepared By**: Agent 3 (Document Intelligence Ops)
- **Date**: 2025-09-20

## 1. Context & Scope
- Advance directive templates (EN & ES) refreshed in cycle-0008 now carry 49 shared variables with bilingual parity for care coordination, storage, and execution metadata (see ops/artifacts/document-intel-cycle-0008/advance-directive-summary.md).
- Compliance requested confirmation that Spanish metadata updates preserve policy-aligned terminology and that notarization/witness instructions satisfy jurisdictional execution requirements (TEAM/Document-Intelligence/memory.json todo).

## 2. Spanish Metadata Review
| Focus Area | Findings | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Variable Coverage | 49 shared variables across identity, contacts, medical preferences, and execution metadata with aligned identifiers in ES/EN. | ops/artifacts/document-intel-cycle-0008/advance-directive-summary.md |
| Terminology QA | Spanish copy mirrors English sections using glossary-compliant terms (e.g., "Persona Otorgante", "Representante", "Autorizacion HIPAA"). No mojibake detected; LegalTranslationEngine guardrails green per document-intel-cycle-0010 checkpoints. | ops/artifacts/document-intel-cycle-0008/advance-directive-summary.md; ops/artifacts/document-intel-cycle-0010/mojibake-scan.txt |
| Execution Metadata | Added bilingual fields for notary name, commission ID/expiry, witness contact blocks, and storage preferences, enabling overlay reuse. | ops/artifacts/document-intel-cycle-0008/advance-directive-summary.md |

## 3. Notarization & Witness Guidance Assessment
- Witness attestations translated and aligned with English legal clauses, clarifying capacity, voluntary execution, and witness independence criteria.
- Notary acknowledgment block includes bilingual jurat language and placeholders for jurisdiction, commission details, and seal placement guidance.
- Provider activation guidance elaborates on when healthcare professionals should honor the directive, reducing ambiguity for Spanish-speaking users.
- No jurisdiction-specific exemptions identified; Washington addenda will inherit guidance via forthcoming localization inserts.

## 4. Risk Review & Mitigations
- **UPL Guardrail**: Non-legal advice disclaimer retained in both languages; flagged for Compliance to include in checklist once Washington addendum lands.
- **Translation Drift**: Mojibake scanner and Jest guardrail (cycle-0010) now cover LegalTranslationEngine sources; parity spot-check passed during review.
- **Execution Failure**: Added explicit storage and revocation mechanics minimize risk of unsigned directives being rejected; notary + witness fields mapped for overlay validation.

## 5. Approvals & Decisions
| Role | Representative | Decision | Date | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Compliance Lead | Jordan Ellis | Approved - Spanish metadata terminology and execution guidance meet policy standards. | 2025-09-20 | Slack #compliance-ops note archived to ops/artifacts/document-intel-cycle-0010/compliance-briefing-spanish-metadata.md |
| Document Intelligence Lead | Priya Shah | Approved - Templates cleared for Document Intelligence deployment workflow. | 2025-09-20 | Handoff meeting notes appended below |
| Localization QA | Alicia Gomez | Approved - Spanish copy ready for parity regression inclusion. | 2025-09-20 | QA checklist update logged in TEAM/Document-Intelligence/memory.json |

### Handoff Notes
- Compliance will surface this briefing during the next release gate review to certify bilingual execution metadata coverage.
- Document Intelligence to update verify-templates smoke suite with notarization + witness fields before 2025-09-22 release freeze.

## 6. Follow-Ups
1. Document Intelligence: automate parity assertions for new notarization fields within verify-templates (in progress).
2. Compliance: incorporate briefing into release gate artifact index and notify Redwood Legal once Washington addenda localizations land.
3. Localization QA: monitor future jurisdiction inserts to ensure glossary terms remain aligned.
