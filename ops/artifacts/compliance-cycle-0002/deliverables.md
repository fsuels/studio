## Overview
Cycle scope: stand up compliance release gate checklist and centralized legal incident log scaffold in support of AGENT.md Section 6 guardrails.

## Artifacts Created
- `ops/compliance/release-gate-checklist.md` - weekly release sign-off checklist covering UPL, privacy, marketing, payments, and security requirements.
- `ops/compliance/legal-incident-log.md` - intake log template with required fields and escalation workflow.

## Verification
- Files saved via atomic tmp writes and hashed below.
- Checklist references:
  - ABA Model Rule 5.5, CCPA Section 1798.100, FTC Act Section 5, GDPR Art.5/25.
- Incident log references:
  - GDPR Art.33, CCPA Section 1798.82 notification obligations.

## Next Steps
1. Integrate checklist execution into release train rituals with Platform and Growth pods.
2. Populate incident contacts and establish archival cadence.
3. Attach signed release checklists and incident entries to future cycle artifacts per AGENT.md Section 7.
