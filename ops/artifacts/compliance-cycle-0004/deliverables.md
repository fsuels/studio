# Compliance Cycle 0004 Deliverables

## Overview
Scope: operationalize the legal incident workflow by defining contact roster, escalation steps, and archival cadence mandated by GDPR Art.33 and state breach statutes.

## Artifacts
- ops/compliance/legal-incident-contacts.md - contact roster, escalation workflow, quarterly archival requirements.
- Updated ops/compliance/legal-incident-log.md - references roster and includes populated contacts.
- Updated ops/compliance/release-gate-checklist.md - points UPL, privacy, and marketing sections to policy files.

## Key Updates
1. Added named contacts (Compliance, Platform, Privacy, Payments, Support, CEO, external counsel) with channels for incident bridge activation.
2. Documented quarterly archive process for incident records (ops/archive/legal-incidents/<year>-Q<quarter>.md).
3. Logged roster change history to support future revisions.
4. Release gate Section 1/2/3 reference policy markdowns to enforce evidence collection.

## Follow-Ups
- Populate Spanish policy translations and update incident contacts when staffing changes occur.
- Integrate incident contact roster into company on-call rotations and PagerDuty schedule exports.
- Automate archival reminder post-quarter via ops tooling.
