## Notes
- Spanish template replaces the vehicle bill of sale placeholder with a medical consent authorization covering caregiver authority, insurance, and emergency contacts while mirroring the English structure.
- English template now includes explicit authorization period, signature block with agreement date, and the global ## Signatures marker; both languages pass with only formatting warnings remaining.
- Broader verification continues to fail because of untouched legacy placeholders and metadata alias gaps elsewhere in the catalog.
