# Jurisdiction Notice Matrix

Last generated: 2025-09-19T17:49:46Z UTC

Purpose: centralize per-state customer disclosure requirements and surface ownership ahead of release gating. Detailed statutory notes live in `ops/compliance/jurisdiction-us-baseline.md`.

## Usage
1. Copy the relevant state row into the current release cycle artifact and update the `Status`, `Owner`, and `Evidence` columns as work progresses.
2. When a row moves to `Complete`, attach the supporting screenshots or policy diffs under `ops/artifacts/<cycle-id>/jurisdiction/` and record the path in the release checklist.
3. Update `Last Reviewed` when counsel or compliance validates the content; include timezone in ISO 8601 format where possible.

## Follow-Up Actions
- Build automation to ingest state bulletin RSS feeds and sync this matrix (tracked in `ops/backlog/legal-monitoring.md`).
- Pair this matrix with marketing claim restrictions so Growth can localize promotions safely.
- Add territories (PR, GU, VI) once U.S. state coverage reaches 80%.
