+## Shared Active Risks
+- CSP telemetry currently logs to console only; no durable storage or alerting.
+- Duplicate middleware and Next.js config files risk drift in routing and security behaviour.
+- Incident response playbook absent; no documented communications or rehearsal schedule.
+- Customer-facing policies (disclaimer, ToS, privacy, refund) absent or placeholder; FTC Act Section 5 and state refund statutes exposure.
+- Compliance release gate checklist missing; UPL and privacy reviews not enforced before deploys.
+- Jurisdiction knowledge base incomplete (only CA plus general data); nationwide coverage mandate unmet.
+- International launch claims lack supporting legal research; GDPR transfer safeguards undefined.
+
+## Cross-Pod Follow-Ups
+1. Persist CSP reports to durable store with alerting pipeline. (Platform -> Compliance)
+2. Consolidate middleware and Next.js config duplication before enforcing headers. (Platform)
+3. Draft incident communication playbook aligned with Platform and Compliance expectations. (Platform -> Compliance)
+4. Co-design release gate instrumentation with Platform to capture legal sign-offs each train. (Compliance -> Platform)
+5. Coordinate with Document Intelligence on state-by-state compliance brief delivery cadence. (Compliance -> DocumentIntelligence)
+6. Align Growth marketing copy with forthcoming disclaimers and refund language. (Compliance -> Growth)
+7. Partner with Payments on refund SOP and policy implementation. (Compliance -> Payments)
+8. Confirm overlay ingestion and PDF field map deployment once Document Intelligence backfills mappings. (DocumentIntelligence -> Platform)
