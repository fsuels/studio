# Memory System Integration Guide
*How CLAUDE_MEMORY.md and CLAUDE_STATE.json work with existing quality control*

## üéØ Overview

The Claude memory system seamlessly integrates with the project's existing quality control infrastructure to provide:
- **Crash Recovery**: Never lose context during session interruptions
- **Quality Compliance**: Maintain 99.7/100 quality standards
- **Workflow Alignment**: Follow established prompt chains and architectural patterns
- **Progress Tracking**: Clear audit trail across all sessions

## üîó Integration Matrix

| Memory System | Existing File | Integration Purpose |
|---------------|---------------|-------------------|
| `CLAUDE_MEMORY.md` | `enhanced_claude_workflow.md` | Follow prompt chain patterns |
| `CLAUDE_STATE.json` | `enhanced_project_plan.md` | Align with checkpoint system |
| Both | `QUALITY_SYSTEM.md` | Maintain quality standards |
| Both | `ARCHITECTURAL_DECISIONS.md` | Respect ADR compliance |
| Both | `AGENTS.md` | Follow development standards |

## üìã Workflow Integration

### 1. Session Startup Protocol
```bash
# Claude should always start by reading these files in order:
1. CLAUDE_MEMORY.md          # Human-readable context
2. CLAUDE_STATE.json         # Structured state data  
3. enhanced_claude_workflow.md # Prompt chain patterns
4. enhanced_project_plan.md   # Current checkpoint context
5. QUALITY_SYSTEM.md         # Quality requirements
```

### 2. During Development
- **Follow Chain Patterns**: Use established prompt chains from `enhanced_claude_workflow.md`
- **Respect Architecture**: Comply with ADRs in `ARCHITECTURAL_DECISIONS.md`
- **Maintain Quality**: Run quality checks per `QUALITY_SYSTEM.md`
- **Update Memory**: Log progress in both memory files continuously

### 3. Session Completion
```bash
# Before ending session:
1. Update CLAUDE_MEMORY.md with session summary
2. Update CLAUDE_STATE.json with technical details
3. Run quality verification: npm run quality-check
4. Verify architectural compliance
5. Log any issues or next steps
```

## üèóÔ∏è Architectural Compliance

### ADR-001: Component Organization
Memory system respects functional category organization:
- **UI Components**: Design system primitives
- **Forms**: Form-related components with validation  
- **Workflow**: Document creation workflow components
- **Document**: Document handling and display

### ADR-002: Document Library Structure
Memory system follows folder-based structure:
```
src/lib/documents/[jurisdiction]/[document-name]/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.ts      # Main export
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ metadata.ts   # Document metadata  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ schema.ts     # Zod validation schema
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ questions.ts  # Form questions
```

## üìä Quality System Integration

### Quality Gates
- **Pre-commit**: Memory updates trigger quality verification
- **Continuous**: Real-time monitoring via `npm run monitor`
- **Automated**: CI/CD pipeline includes memory validation

### Quality Commands Integration
```bash
# Commands that memory system should track:
npm run quality-check      # Technical validation
npm run legal-check        # Legal compliance  
npm run translation-check  # Translation validation
npm run seo-check         # SEO content validation
npm run full-check        # Integrated validation
npm run monitor           # Real-time dashboard
```

### Quality Score Tracking
Memory system tracks quality metrics:
- **Target**: 99.7/100 score maintenance
- **Monitoring**: Real-time via dashboard
- **Alerting**: Integration with Sl notification system
- **Prevention**: Pre-commit hooks prevent degradation

## üîÑ Prompt Chain Integration

### Feature Implementation Chain (Used in LLC Session)
1. **REQUIREMENTS**: Extract and clarify feature requirements
2. **DESIGN**: Create technical design fitting existing architecture
3. **BREAKDOWN**: Decompose into incremental commits  
4. **BUILD**: Implement each component with tests
5. **INTEGRATE**: Merge components and verify functionality

### Quality Verification Chain
1. **VERIFY**: Run npm run verify-templates
2. **IDENTIFY**: List failing templates with errors
3. **FIX**: Run npm run fix-templates for automated fixes
4. **VALIDATE**: Re-run verification for completion
5. **MONITOR**: Use npm run monitor-templates for tracking
6. **PREVENT**: Ensure pre-commit hooks prevent future issues

## üöÄ Enhanced Project Plan Alignment

### Checkpoint Integration
Memory system aligns with project checkpoints:
- **Checkpoint 1**: Foundation & Architecture Cleanup  
- **Checkpoint 2**: Testing Infrastructure & Quality Assurance
- **Checkpoint 3**: User Experience Enhancement (LLC Session)
- **Checkpoint 4**: Document Library Expansion
- **Checkpoint 5**: Feature Expansion & Integrations

### Progress Tracking
- **Session Mapping**: Each session maps to specific checkpoints
- **Chain Execution**: Track which prompt chains were used
- **Quality Metrics**: Monitor quality score across checkpoints
- **Technical Debt**: Document and track resolution

## üìù Best Practices

### For Claude Sessions
1. **Always read memory files first** before starting work
2. **Follow established prompt chains** from workflow documentation
3. **Respect architectural decisions** in all implementations
4. **Maintain quality standards** throughout development
5. **Update memory continuously** during session
6. **Run quality checks** before session completion

### For Memory Updates
1. **Human-readable summaries** in CLAUDE_MEMORY.md
2. **Structured technical data** in CLAUDE_STATE.json
3. **Reference related files** for context
4. **Track quality metrics** and compliance
5. **Log architectural decisions** and rationale
6. **Document integration points** with existing systems
