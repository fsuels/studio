# üéØ Decision Logic & Exception Escalation Analysis

## Current State Assessment

### ‚úÖ What We Have:

1. **Quality Scoring** (99.7/100) - but no decision logic on what to do with scores
2. **Legal Compliance Checks** - but no escalation for critical violations
3. **Translation Validation** - but no decision tree for different confidence levels
4. **Error Logging** - but no automated escalation workflows
5. **Pre-commit Hooks** - but simple pass/fail, no nuanced decisions

### ‚ùå What We're Missing:

1. **Intelligent Decision Trees** - Different actions based on severity levels
2. **Automated Escalation Workflows** - Route issues to appropriate teams
3. **Risk-Based Prioritization** - Critical legal issues vs minor quality issues
4. **Conditional Processing** - Different workflows for different error types
5. **Recovery Mechanisms** - Automatic fixes vs manual review requirements

## Why This Is Critical for Legal Documents

### Current Problems:

- **Binary Decisions**: Currently everything is pass/fail
- **No Prioritization**: Translation warnings treated same as legal violations
- **Manual Escalation**: No automatic routing of critical issues
- **Risk Blindness**: System doesn't understand legal vs technical risks

### What We Need:

- **Smart Routing**: Legal issues ‚Üí Legal team, Technical issues ‚Üí Dev team
- **Risk Assessment**: Critical legal violations block immediately
- **Graduated Responses**: Different actions for different severity levels
- **Automatic Recovery**: Self-healing for minor issues

## Recommended Decision Logic Framework

### Severity Levels:

1. **CRITICAL** - Blocks deployment, immediate escalation
2. **HIGH** - Requires review before merge
3. **MEDIUM** - Automated fix attempted, then review if fails
4. **LOW** - Log and continue, periodic review

### Decision Matrix:

```
Issue Type    | Severity | Auto Action        | Escalation
Legal Clause  | CRITICAL | Block + Alert      | Legal Team + CTO
Translation   | HIGH     | English Fallback   | Content Team
Quality Score | MEDIUM   | Auto-fix attempt   | Dev Team
Linting       | LOW      | Auto-fix + Log     | Weekly Review
```
