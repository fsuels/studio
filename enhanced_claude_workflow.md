# Enhanced Claude Workflow with Advanced Prompt Chaining

## Core Workflow Architecture

### Phase 1: Problem Decomposition Chain

**Purpose**: Break complex problems into manageable, sequential tasks

#### Chain Step 1.1: Context Gathering

```
PROMPT: "Analyze the codebase structure and identify:
1. Main architectural patterns
2. Key dependencies and integrations
3. Technical debt indicators
4. Current pain points
Output as structured JSON with confidence scores."
```

#### Chain Step 1.2: Problem Classification

```
PROMPT: "Based on the analysis from Step 1.1:
- Classify issues by: complexity (1-5), impact (1-5), dependencies
- Group related issues into logical work streams
- Identify blocking dependencies
Output as prioritized task matrix."
```

#### Chain Step 1.3: Solution Planning

```
PROMPT: "Using the task matrix from Step 1.2:
- Create detailed implementation plans for top 3 priorities
- Define success criteria for each task
- Estimate effort and identify risks
Output as actionable project plan."
```

### Phase 2: Implementation Chain

#### Chain Step 2.1: Code Analysis

```
PROMPT: "For task [X] from the project plan:
1. Read relevant files: [list from previous analysis]
2. Map current implementation
3. Identify exact changes needed
4. Check for side effects
Output as implementation blueprint."
```

#### Chain Step 2.2: Code Generation

```
PROMPT: "Using the blueprint from Step 2.1:
- Generate minimal, focused code changes
- Include inline documentation
- Add test cases for changes
- Ensure backward compatibility
Output as unified diff format."
```

#### Chain Step 2.3: Validation & Review

```
PROMPT: "Review the code changes from Step 2.2:
- Check against original requirements
- Verify no unintended side effects
- Confirm test coverage
- Generate summary for human review
Output as review checklist with confidence scores."
```

## Advanced Search & Retrieval Integration

### Pattern 1: Dynamic Context Building

```yaml
search_chain:
  - initial_search: 'Find all files mentioning [component/feature]'
  - relevance_filter: 'Rank results by modification date and import frequency'
  - deep_search: 'For top 5 results, extract implementation details'
  - context_synthesis: 'Create comprehensive context document'
```

### Pattern 2: Progressive Documentation Search

```yaml
documentation_chain:

## Meta-Prompting Patterns

### Self-Improving Chains

```
REFLECTION_PROMPT: "Analyze the output quality of the previous chain:
- What worked well?
- What could be improved?
- How should the next iteration be adjusted?
Generate improved prompt for next execution."
```

### Enhanced Confidence Scoring Chain with Business Intelligence

```
CONFIDENCE_PROMPT: "For each step in the chain:
- Calculate base confidence in understanding (0-100%)
- Apply business intelligence weighting: impact × risk ÷ cost
- Apply risk penalty for high-risk documents (15% stricter)
- Track consecutive failures across 3 tasks
- Pause system and alert Sl if 3 consecutive failures < 70%
- Identify areas needing human verification
- Suggest additional searches if weighted confidence < 70%
Output as enhanced risk assessment matrix with business metrics."
```

### Business Intelligence Weighting Chain

```
BUSINESS_INTELLIGENCE_CHAIN:
1. IMPACT_ASSESSMENT: "Rate document legal liability potential (1-10)"
2. RISK_CALCULATION: "Calculate regulatory/legal consequences multiplier (1.0-3.0)"
3. COST_ANALYSIS: "Estimate translation fix cost in hours (1-12)"
4. WEIGHTED_SCORING: "Apply formula: (impact × risk ÷ cost) to base confidence"
5. CONSECUTIVE_TRACKING: "Monitor failure patterns and pause system protection"
6. SL_ALERTING: "Generate immediate notifications for critical issues"
Output as business-intelligent confidence decision."
```

### SEO Content Uniqueness & Dynamic Monitoring Chain

```
SEO_PROTECTION_CHAIN:
1. CONTENT_ANALYSIS: "Analyze all content files for uniqueness using embeddings"
2. SIMILARITY_DETECTION: "Flag content overlap >20% between pages"
3. THIN_CONTENT_CHECK: "Identify pages <300 words requiring expansion"
4. KEYWORD_OPTIMIZATION: "Validate keyword density (1-3% target range)"
5. AHREFS_MONITORING: "Weekly API calls for keyword ranking changes"
6. SITEMAP_ADJUSTMENT: "Dynamic priority updates based on performance"

```

### Market Readiness + Staged Rollout Validation Chain

```
MARKET_READINESS_CHAIN:
1. DATABASE_PRELOAD: "Populate market_requirements.db with country-specific compliance data"
2. COMPLIANCE_SCORING: "Calculate weighted scores across 5 categories: legal, regulatory, technical, market, operational"
3. THRESHOLD_GATING: "Apply 0.85 compliance threshold - block launch if below"
4. RISK_ADJUSTMENT: "Apply legal complexity multiplier for final adjusted score"
5. STAGED_VALIDATION: "Validate multiple markets simultaneously with tier-based sequencing"
6. BLOCKER_IDENTIFICATION: "Categorize critical blockers requiring immediate resolution"
7. LAUNCH_SEQUENCING: "Generate optimal rollout timeline based on readiness scores"
8. DEPLOYMENT_GATING: "Automatically block deployment for non-compliant markets"
Output as risk-gated international expansion system with compliance-based launch control."

## Best Practices

### Chain Design Principles

1. **Single Responsibility**: Each chain step has one clear objective
2. **Progressive Enhancement**: Build complexity gradually
3. **Fail-Safe Design**: Include validation at each step
4. **Context Preservation**: Pass relevant context forward
5. **Human Checkpoints**: Insert review points for critical decisions

### Output Formatting Standards

- Always output structured data (JSON/YAML) for chain inputs
- Include confidence scores and uncertainty flags
- Provide both summary and detailed views
- Enable easy rollback with clear change tracking

### Error Handling Patterns

```yaml
error_chain:
  - detect: 'Identify error type and severity'
  - diagnose: 'Trace error to root cause'
  - recover: 'Suggest recovery strategies'
  - prevent: 'Recommend preventive measures'
  - document: 'Update knowledge base'
```
