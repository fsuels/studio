# Auto-Memory.md
run: 7
chosen_tasks:
  - Repaired Codex autorun start.exp so tmux sessions render the rich UI and allow manual takeover
  - Synced updated expect script into both Windows kit and active WSL loop directory
  - Added autorun pause/resume controls (autorunctl.sh + Windows GUI)
notes:
  - Force TERM=xterm-256color and COLORTERM=truecolor before spawning Codex to avoid fallback watch mode
  - Limit expect automation to menu prompts, then hand control to interact while still auto-sending Ctrl-D on EXIT
  - Introduced state/autorun.paused sentinel handling in loop.sh with autorunctl.sh helper and AutorunControl.ps1 UI for toggling
results:
  ops:
    codex_autorun: New controls in place; restart confirmed and pause/resume commands wired via autorunctl.sh
pending_tasks:
  - Extend canonical and hreflang coverage to other marketing routes
  - Revisit CSP enablement once PDF compatibility issues are resolved
  - Validate autorun loop changes during next scheduled cycle
next_steps:
  - Fold parity checks into CI once stability confirmed
  - QA clause parity and placeholders across broader contract inventory
  - Observe next autorun execution for UI fidelity, pause/resume notifications, and manual override checks
