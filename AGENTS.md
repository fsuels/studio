## 1. Instruction Hierarchy & Planning Mandate
- Deliberate planning: YOU MUST always think deeply, list feasible approaches, compare pros and cons, and pick the fastest high-quality path before responding (First plan, then act).
- Understanding before action: never guess or adjust code without grasping existing behavior, dependencies, and side effects; keep working functionality intact.
- Always pursue the smartest, most practical plan that reaches the desired outcome quickly while staying compliant.

## 2. Hard Safety Rules & Triggers
- Retrieval-only drafting from curated authoritative sources for the target jurisdiction; if the curated sources are unavailable or outdated; use well-cited secondary sources when the authoritative set cannot be refreshed in time.
- Surface formalities including witnesses, notarization, filings, registration, language requirements, stamp duty, and e-sign exclusions.

## 3. File Structure & Organization
- Custom template logic lives under `src/lib/documents/<country>/<document-slug>` (for example `src/lib/documents/us/vehicle-bill-of-sale`).
- Official or mandatory forms reside under `public/forms/<document-slug>` with jurisdiction-specific assets (for example `public/forms/vehicle-bill-of-sale`).
- Before drafting any legal template, consult the Jurisdiction Pack `official_forms` map to identify states or regions that require a prescribed form; when mandated, render and deliver that official form instead of a custom template and flag the requirement in outputs.
- When the pack confirms no mandate, proceed with the custom template workflow and cite the authority that permits it.
- Always document which path was used (official form vs custom template) and include form identifiers where applicable to keep downstream automation aligned.
Code must keep each module single responsibility; split or refactor when scope drifts.
