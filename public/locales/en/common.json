  "faq.q2.question": "Is 123LegalDoc a law firm? Do you provide legal advice?",
  "faq.q2.answer": "No, 123LegalDoc is not a law firm and we do not provide legal advice. Our platform offers software and self-help services at your direction. We recommend consulting with a qualified attorney for complex legal matters or personalized advice.",
  "faq.q3.question": "How does the AI help in document generation?",
  "faq.q3.answer": "Our AI helps by inferring the type of document you might need based on your description of the situation. During the questionnaire, it can help ensure clarity and suggest relevant clauses based on your answers and the document type. However, it is not a substitute for legal review.",
  "faq.q4.question": "Are the documents state-specific?",
  "faq.q4.answer": "Many of our documents are tailored to be compliant with the laws of specific U.S. states. When you select your state, the document and its clauses will adjust accordingly where applicable. Always verify specific state requirements with a legal professional if unsure.",
  "faq.q5.question": "Can I edit the documents after they are generated?",
  "faq.q5.answer": "Yes, after the initial generation based on your answers, you will have the opportunity to review and edit the document in a rich text editor before finalizing it. This allows for further customization.",
  "faq.q6.question": "What if I need a document that is not listed?",
  "faq.q6.answer": "You can use our 'General Inquiry' option to describe your needs. While we may not be able to generate a custom document on the spot, your input helps us understand demand and prioritize new templates. For urgent or complex needs not covered, consulting an attorney is recommended.",
