    "faq.q1.question": "Is 123LegalDoc a law firm?",
    "faq.q1.answer": "No, 123LegalDoc is a software platform that provides tools for creating legal documents. We are not a law firm and do not provide legal advice. We recommend consulting with a licensed attorney for complex legal matters.",
    "faq.q2.question": "Are the documents legally binding?",
    "faq.q2.answer": "Our documents are drafted by experienced legal professionals and are designed to be legally sound when filled out correctly and used in the appropriate jurisdiction. However, the specific enforceability can depend on your jurisdiction and the unique facts of your situation. It's always best to have critical documents reviewed by an attorney.",
    "faq.q3.question": "Can I use these documents in any U.S. state?",
    "faq.q3.answer": "Many of our documents are designed for general use across the U.S. or are adaptable for specific states. Where state-specific laws are critical (e.g., real estate, eviction), our questionnaires and templates aim to incorporate those requirements. Always verify specific state compliance for important matters.",
    "faq.q4.question": "What if I make a mistake on my document?",
    "faq.q4.answer": "You can typically edit your document through our platform before finalizing it. If you've already finalized or signed it, the ability to make changes depends on the nature of the document and whether it's been filed or shared. For significant changes post-finalization, creating a new document or an amendment (if applicable) might be necessary.",
    "faq.q5.question": "How is my data protected?",
    "faq.q5.answer": "We take data security seriously. We use encryption for data in transit and at rest, and follow industry best practices to protect your personal information and document data. Please see our Privacy Policy for more details.",
    "faq.q6.question": "What if I need a document not listed?",
    "faq.q6.answer": "Our library is constantly expanding. If you can't find what you need, you can use our 'General Inquiry' option to describe your situation, and our AI may suggest an existing template or help you understand your needs better. You can also contact our support team with suggestions.",
