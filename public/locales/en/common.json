    "faq.q1.answer": "No, 123LegalDoc is not a law firm and does not provide legal advice. We provide software and information to help you create your own legal documents. For legal advice, please consult a qualified attorney.",
    "faq.q2.question": "Are the documents legally binding?",
    "faq.q2.answer": "Our documents are drafted based on common legal requirements and best practices. However, the legal validity of a document can depend on many factors, including how it's filled out, signed, and the specific laws of your jurisdiction. We always recommend having critical documents reviewed by an attorney.",
    "faq.q3.question": "What if I need a document for a specific U.S. state?",
    "faq.q3.answer": "Many of our templates are designed to be valid in all 50 states or allow for state-specific customizations. You can select your state during the document creation process, and our system will help tailor it. However, state laws can be very specific, so for complex matters, consulting a local attorney is advised.",
    "faq.q4.question": "Can I edit the documents after generating them?",
    "faq.q4.answer": "Yes, when you generate a document, you'll typically receive it in a common format like PDF. While direct editing of the generated PDF might be limited, you can often re-generate the document with different answers through our platform if you need to make changes before finalizing it. Our goal is to help you create it correctly the first time.",
    "faq.q5.question": "What is your refund policy?",
    "faq.q5.answer": "We offer a satisfaction guarantee. If you are not satisfied with your document purchase for any reason, please contact our support team within [Number] days of purchase for assistance or a refund.",
    "faq.q6.question": "How is my data protected?",
    "faq.q6.answer": "We take data privacy and security seriously. We use encryption for data in transit and at rest, and follow industry best practices to protect your personal information. For more details, please see our Privacy Policy.",
