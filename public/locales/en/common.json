  "faq.q2.question": "Are the documents legally binding?",
  "faq.q2.answer": "Our documents are drafted based on common legal principles and requirements. However, 123LegalDoc is not a law firm and does not provide legal advice. For complex situations or if you need legal assurance, we recommend consulting with a qualified attorney in your jurisdiction. Many documents, like contracts, become legally binding when properly signed by all parties. Some documents may require notarization or witnesses depending on your state and the document type.",
  "faq.q3.question": "How does the AI document inference work?",
  "faq.q3.answer": "You can describe your situation in your own words (via text or voice). Our AI analyzes your input and suggests relevant document types from our library. This helps you find the right starting point quickly.",
  "faq.q4.question": "Can I edit the documents after they are generated?",
  "faq.q4.answer": "Yes! After answering the questionnaire, you'll be able to review a preview of your document. While the core legal clauses generated from your answers are set, you typically have options to add custom text or make minor adjustments in a review step before finalizing for PDF generation and signing.",
  "faq.q5.question": "Is my information secure?",
  "faq.q5.answer": "We take your privacy and data security very seriously. We use industry-standard encryption and security practices to protect your information. Please review our Privacy Policy for more details.",
  "faq.q6.question": "What if I can't find the document I need?",
  "faq.q6.answer": "Our library is constantly growing. If you can't find a specific document, you can use our 'General Inquiry' option to describe your needs. While we can't create custom documents on the fly that constitute legal advice, your feedback helps us prioritize new templates. You can also contact our support team for assistance.",
