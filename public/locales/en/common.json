    "faq.q1.answer": "No, 123LegalDoc is not a law firm and does not provide legal advice. We provide software and self-help services at your direction. We recommend consulting with a licensed attorney for complex legal issues.",
    "faq.q2.question": "How does the AI document generation work?",
    "faq.q2.answer": "Our AI helps you identify the document you might need based on your description of your situation. Then, it guides you through a series of questions. Your answers are used to populate a professionally drafted template. You can then review, edit, and finalize your document.",
    "faq.q3.question": "Are the documents legally binding?",
    "faq.q3.answer": "Our templates are drafted by legal professionals and are designed to be legally sound. However, the enforceability of any document depends on many factors, including the accuracy of the information you provide and compliance with specific state laws. For critical matters, we always recommend having your document reviewed by an attorney.",
    "faq.q4.question": "What if I need a document for a specific U.S. state?",
    "faq.q4.answer": "Many of our templates are designed for general applicability across the U.S. or can be tailored. When state-specific clauses are critical (e.g., for real estate or eviction), our system will often guide you or prompt for state information. Always verify state-specific requirements.",
    "faq.q5.question": "Can I edit the documents after they are generated?",
    "faq.q5.answer": "Yes! After the initial AI-assisted generation, you'll have access to an editor to make custom changes, add or remove clauses, and tailor the document to your exact needs before finalizing.",
    "faq.q6.question": "What about privacy and security?",
    "faq.q6.answer": "We take your privacy and data security very seriously. We use industry-standard encryption and security practices to protect your information. Please review our Privacy Policy for full details.",
