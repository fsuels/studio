  "faq": {
    "q1": {
      "question": "Is an e-signed promissory note legally binding?",
      "answer": "Yes. Under the U.S. Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce (E-SIGN) Act and the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act (UETA) adopted by most states, electronic signatures carry the same legal weight as handwritten signatures for most transactions, including promissory notes."
    },
    "q2": {
      "question": "Do I need a witness or notary for a promissory note?",
      "answer": "Requirements vary by state and the nature of the loan. While not always mandatory for simple notes, notarization or witness signatures can significantly strengthen the note's enforceability by verifying the identities of the signers. Some states require it for notes involving real estate or larger sums. Our platform will indicate if notarization is recommended for your state."
    },
    "q3": {
      "question": "What happens if the borrower defaults on the promissory note?",
      "answer": "If a borrower defaults (e.g., misses payments), the lender can take legal action as outlined in the note's 'Default & Remedies' clause. This may include demanding full repayment of the outstanding balance (acceleration), suing for the debt, or, if the note is secured, seizing the specified collateral. Collection costs and attorney fees may also be recoverable if stipulated."
    },
    "q4": {
      "question": "Can I change the terms of a promissory note later?",
      "answer": "Yes, the terms of a promissory note can be changed if both the lender and borrower agree in writing. This is typically done through a 'Promissory Note Amendment' or 'Modification Agreement,' which should be signed by all parties. 123LegalDoc offers templates for such amendments."
    },
    "q5": {
      "question": "Is interest earned from a promissory note taxable?",
      "answer": "Yes, interest income received by the lender is generally taxable and must be reported to the IRS. The borrower may be able to deduct interest paid if the loan was for business, investment, or certain educational purposes, subject to IRS rules."
