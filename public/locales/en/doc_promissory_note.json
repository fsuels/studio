  "faq": {
    "q1": {
      "question": "What's the difference between a loan agreement and a promissory note?",
      "answer": "A promissory note is generally simpler and focuses on the promise to pay. A loan agreement is typically more comprehensive, detailing extensive terms, conditions, representations, and warranties for both parties, especially for complex business loans."
    },
    "q2": {
      "question": "Can I charge any interest rate I want?",
      "answer": "No. Most states and provinces have usury laws that cap the maximum legal interest rate. Charging above this can make the interest (or even the entire loan) unenforceable. Always check your local laws."
    },
    "q3": {
      "question": "Does a promissory note need to be notarized?",
      "answer": "It varies by jurisdiction and the loan amount. While not always legally required for validity between the parties, notarization adds a layer of authenticity and can be beneficial if the note needs to be enforced in court."
    },
    "q4": {
      "question": "What happens if the borrower doesn't pay?",
      "answer": "The lender can take legal action to recover the debt, as outlined in the note's default clause. This might include sending demand letters, suing in small claims court, or pursuing other collection methods. If the note is secured, the lender may also have rights to the collateral."
    },
    "q5": {
      "question": "Can I use this template for a business loan?",
      "answer": "Yes, this template can be adapted for simple business loans between individuals or entities. For very complex commercial lending, a more detailed Loan Agreement might be advisable. Consult a legal professional if unsure."
