## Pod Status Snapshots
### Platform Engineering
- last_cycle: platform-cycle-0004
- risks: CSP alerts depend on external webhook availability; alert delivery lacks observability; incident playbook unresolved
- focus_next: instrument alert metrics, add webhook tests/staging config, draft incident communication playbook

### Document Intelligence
- last_cycle: document-intel-cycle-0003
- risks: Overlay field maps missing for power-of-attorney and two vehicle BOS states; placeholder registry still limited to 4 templates; compliance review of new Spanish metadata pending
- focus_next: backfill overlays, broaden placeholder parity suite, automate translation parity checks, coordinate compliance validation

### AI & Automation
- last_cycle: ai-automation-cycle-0001
- risks: Genkit pipelines remain stubbed; OSS gateway deployment plus guardrails/evaluations/observability are still outstanding.
- focus_next: stand up LiteLLM/vLLM gateway with managed secrets, add guardrails + bilingual evaluations, and hook Langfuse/Prometheus telemetry

### Compliance & Legal Ops
- last_cycle: compliance-cycle-0002
- risks: Public policy stack still placeholders; release gate checklist adoption pending; incident log contacts unassigned; jurisdiction tracker limited to CA
- focus_next: Draft bilingual policies, operationalize release gate checklist with weekly sign-offs, populate incident log contacts, expand state knowledge base

### Growth & Customer Learning
- last_cycle: growth-cycle-0002
- risks: SignWell events instrumented but funnel API still relies on mock/localStorage data; translations rely on per-page helpers; GA4 ingestion pending
- focus_next: Partner with Platform to ingest new events and replace mock metrics, stand up translation catalogs, prep bilingual pricing/trust experiments

### Payments & Monetization
- last_cycle: reset
- risks: Stripe integration mocked; no reporting pipeline
- focus_next: map required endpoints, design webhook handling, draft refund/dispute SOP

### CEO
- last_cycle: ceo-cycle-0001
- risks: Security header enforcement blocked by telemetry gap; policy stack delays impact launch readiness; KPI instrumentation still missing
- focus_next: Assign KPI instrumentation owners, schedule cross-pod unblock session (Platform/Compliance/Payments/Growth), publish cycle rotation cadence
