# Payments & Monetization Playbook

## Mission Contribution
Unlock reliable revenue capture through secure, compliant payment systems, subscription management, and financial reporting that support our self-help legal platform.

## Charter
- Implement production-grade Stripe integrations (Checkout, Billing, Invoicing) replacing current mocks.
- Manage pricing catalogs, coupons, bundles, and business accounts (single doc, 5-pack, Business Pro, enterprise).
- Own refunds, chargebacks, tax compliance (U.S. state taxes now, global taxes as we expand), and PCI/SOC documentation.
- Deliver financial analytics: revenue reporting, MRR/ARR, churn, attachment rates, cohort analyses.
- Coordinate with support and Compliance on billing policies, disclosures, and customer communications.

## 90-Day Objectives
1. Ship end-to-end Stripe integration (client + server + webhooks) with automated tests and failure alerts.
2. Launch subscription & bundle offerings with provisioning hooks into Firebase and document quotas.
3. Establish finance data pipeline (Stripe -> warehouse/BI) with reconciled monthly statements and dashboards.
4. Document refund, chargeback, and dispute response playbooks aligned with Compliance-approved policies.

## KPIs & Targets
- Payment success rate: >=95% for first-attempt card transactions.
- Revenue accuracy: 100% reconciliation between Stripe and internal ledger monthly.
- Refund SLA: process within 2 business days; refund rate <5% of total orders.
- Chargeback rate: <0.5% of transactions; disputes responded to within 5 days.
- Subscription churn: <5% monthly; attach rate of add-on services >=25% once launched.

## Operating Cadence
- Daily: monitor payment success dashboards, webhook failures, dispute alerts, and uptime of billing services.
- Weekly: review revenue metrics with CEO, evaluate A/B pricing experiments, sync with Platform on deployment changes.
- Monthly: reconcile Stripe payouts with accounting records, review tax filings, update forecasting model.
- Quarterly: reassess pricing strategy, plan international payment rollout (local methods, currency). 

## System Ownership
- `src/lib/stripe-integration.ts`, `src/lib/payment-processor.ts`, serverless functions for webhooks.
- Billing datastore (FireStore collections for subscriptions, usage, invoices) and quota enforcement logic.
- Financial reporting scripts/dashboards (could reside in `scripts/finance-*` or BI tool).
- Secrets management for Stripe keys, webhook signing, tax service integrations.

## Tooling & Integrations
- Stripe (Checkout, Billing, Tax, Radar), webhooks infrastructure with retry/backoff.
- Accounting integrations (QuickBooks/Xero) for future; CSV exports now.
- Analytics: financial dashboards (Looker/Metabase/Tableau) fed from Stripe + internal usage data.
- Testing: Stripe CLI, mocked webhook suites, Playwright end-to-end payment flows.

## Collaboration Map
- Platform Engineering: coordinate deployment of webhook handlers, environment configs, monitoring, and incident response.
- Document Intelligence: flag premium templates or bundles needing pricing adjustments.
- AI & Automation: track AI feature usage for usage-based billing and ensure prompt-based upsell messaging aligns with product.
- Compliance & Legal Ops: align on refund terms, disclosures, tax notices, and PCI requirements.
- Growth & Customer Learning: share pricing insights, support checkout experiments, integrate marketing promotions.

## Risk & Escalation
- Payment outage: enable maintenance messaging, switch to fallback (e.g., manual invoicing), alert CEO + Platform, work with Stripe support.
- Data inconsistency/reconciliation error: freeze financial reporting, investigate root cause, correct entries, notify finance stakeholders.
- Fraud/chargebacks spike: tighten Radar rules, coordinate with Compliance on communication, review for abusive behavior.

## Immediate Next Actions
1. Replace mocked payment processor with real Stripe client/server flows, including webhook signature verification and secret rotation.
2. Build automated tests for checkout + subscription flows (unit + Playwright) and integrate into CI on every release train.
3. Implement usage tracking pipeline connecting document generation events to billing entitlements.
4. Draft customer-facing billing FAQs and internal dispute response checklists with Compliance review.
