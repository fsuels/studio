  "notes": [
    "Genkit interfaces are stubbed in src/ai/ai-instance.ts, leaving intake flows without OSS inference.",
    "Multiple flows rely on NEXT_PUBLIC_OPENAI_API_KEY, exposing secrets and bypassing safety guardrails.",
    "No guardrail stack, evaluation harness, or observability is wired for AI routes; Spanish coverage is absent."

  "todos": [
    "Replace OpenAI SDK usage with vLLM/LiteLLM gateway and server-only key management, removing NEXT_PUBLIC_OPENAI_API_KEY.",
    "Implement Llama Guard 3, Prompt Guard 2, and refusal taxonomy with compliance logging before re-enabling flows.",
    "Stand up bilingual evaluation harness (lm-evaluation-harness + Ragas) with weekly reporting and Spanish fixtures.",
    "Instrument Langfuse + Prometheus metrics and escalation hooks for AI incidents and quota failures."
