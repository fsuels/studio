  "notes": [
    "Genkit interfaces are still stubbed in src/ai/ai-instance.ts, leaving intake flows without OSS inference.",
    "Server-side AI helpers now use the AI gateway abstraction; ClauseTooltip fetches explanations via /api/accessibility/explain-clause, eliminating NEXT_PUBLIC_OPENAI_API_KEY exposure.",
    "No guardrail stack, evaluation harness, or observability is wired for AI routes; Spanish coverage is absent."
  ],
  "todos": [
    "Deploy and document LiteLLM/vLLM gateway configuration (AI_GATEWAY_URL + API key) across environments.",
    "Implement Llama Guard 3, Prompt Guard 2, and refusal taxonomy with compliance logging before re-enabling flows.",
    "Stand up bilingual evaluation harness (lm-evaluation-harness + Ragas) with weekly reporting and Spanish fixtures.",
    "Instrument Langfuse + Prometheus metrics and escalation hooks for AI incidents and quota failures."
