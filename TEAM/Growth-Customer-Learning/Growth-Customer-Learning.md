# Growth & Customer Learning Playbook

## Mission Contribution
Drive sustainable customer acquisition, education, and retention while converting wizard sessions into paid orders without overstating legal claims.

## Charter
- Own marketing funnels: SEO, content, lifecycle email, in-product education, and localization for English/Spanish.
- Design onboarding flows, pricing experiments, and customer research programs to improve conversion and retention.
- Manage analytics instrumentation, dashboards, and qualitative feedback loops (surveys, interviews, support insights).
- Partner on customer support enablement, knowledge base content, and escalation routing.
- Ensure all messaging aligns with compliance guidelines and highlights self-help positioning.

## 90-Day Objectives
1. Launch bilingual marketing site with optimized canonical/hreflang, structured data, and compliant messaging across priority routes.
2. Achieve 8% wizard-to-purchase conversion baseline through onboarding improvements and trust signals.
3. Stand up customer feedback system (NPS, CSAT, support tagging) feeding insights into roadmap prioritization.
4. Deliver pricing & bundle strategy (single doc, 5-pack, Business Pro) validated with data, plus roadmap for international localization.

## KPIs & Targets
- Conversion: wizard start -> purchase >=8%; landing page -> wizard start >=25%.
- Average order value: >=85 USD in first post-launch quarter.
- NPS: >=45 overall, segmented by persona (consumer, small business, team).
- Content velocity: publish minimum 4 high-quality legal education pieces per month with bilingual parity.
- Organic traffic growth: +20% MoM for first six months post-launch (baseline to be defined at launch).

## Operating Cadence
- Daily: monitor funnel dashboards, paid/organic traffic, support tickets; respond to KPI deviations.
- Weekly: experiment review (A/B tests, pricing trials), sync with Platform on analytics/SEO updates, share voice-of-customer insights with leadership.
- Biweekly: localization sprint with Document Intelligence and Compliance to ensure messaging accuracy.
- Monthly: strategy retro to adjust roadmap, present insights to executive staff.

## System Ownership
- Marketing site content (CMS or MDX pages), copy decks, translation repository.
- Analytics instrumentation plan (Google Analytics/GA4, Segment, Amplitude, or in-house dashboards) and data QA.
- Email + lifecycle automation (Customer.io, Braze, or SendGrid) with segmentation logic.
- Customer research repository (interviews, survey data, support transcripts tagged with themes).

## Tooling & Integrations
- SEO toolkit: Google Search Console, Ahrefs, schema validators, Lighthouse.
- Experimentation: Optimizely/LaunchDarkly, built-in feature flags, Playwright funnel tests.
- Feedback: Typeform/SurveyMonkey, Zendesk/Intercom, Hotjar session replay (ensure compliance sign-off).
- Localization: translation management platform or Git-based process with review workflows.

## Collaboration Map
- Platform Engineering: implement analytics, structured data, performance fixes, and experiment flags.
- Document Intelligence: align marketing claims with actual template capabilities and update landing pages as catalog expands.
- AI & Automation: highlight AI features responsibly; gather qualitative feedback to refine prompts.
- Compliance & Legal Ops: pre-approve messaging, testimonials, pricing copy, and guarantee language.
- Payments & Monetization: sync on checkout flows, upsell placements, and refund process communications.

## Risk & Escalation
- Non-compliant messaging: pause campaign, notify Compliance, run root-cause analysis, update review workflow.
- Negative customer signals (NPS drop, refund spike): trigger cross-functional war room, investigate funnel or product gaps.
- Analytics outage or bad data: halt experiment decisions, coordinate with Platform to restore accuracy, document fixes.

## Immediate Next Actions
1. Audit existing marketing routes for canonical/hreflang gaps, structured data coverage, and publish remediation plan.
2. Launch bilingual pricing page trust enhancements (testimonials, guarantees vetted by Compliance) to support conversion target.
3. Implement analytics QA checklist (event naming, localization coverage, consent handling) with Platform sign-off.
4. Stand up customer feedback loop (support tagging + survey triggers) and share first insights deck in two weeks.
