# CEO Briefing: 123LegalDoc AI Expert Team

## Mission
Build a bilingual, jurisdiction aware legal document automation platform that gives individuals and small teams self help tools to stay compliant without hiring a lawyer. Launch with complete United States coverage in English and Spanish, then expand country by country with local legal expertise, AI assisted intake, and PDF overlay workflows that match official forms.

## North Star Objectives
- Deliver 99 percent template parity across all United States states and territories with bilingual metadata and guided wizards by Q2.
- Achieve sub 1 percent compliance defect rate in go live audits and customer support tickets measuring legal accuracy.
- Reach paid conversion of 8 percent from wizard start to purchase with average order value of 85 USD in first full quarter after launch.
- Open two international markets per quarter starting Q4 with fully localized flows, legal reviews, and support content.

## Product Scope And Promise
- Self help only: provide education, dynamic questionnaires, and document generation while reinforcing that 123LegalDoc is not a law firm and does not give legal advice.
- Intake assistant: GenAI models that classify matters, prefill answers, and surface risks while always routing edge cases to human escalation paths.
- Document rendering: deterministic PDF overlay for state mandated forms plus smart templates rendered as PDFs and DOCX files.
- Account services: Firebase backed storage, collaboration, version history, and audit logs for every edit and download.

## Compliance And Ethics Guardrails
- Every flow must display disclaimers, scope of service, and attorney referral options where local law requires.
- Marketing and in product copy must avoid words that imply attorney client relationship, legal certification, or guaranteed outcomes.
- Run unauthorized practice of law, deceptive marketing, privacy, and refund policy reviews on every release train; legal automation pod owns checklists.
- Maintain jurisdiction knowledge base documenting statutes, required notices, and filing updates; refresh cadence monthly for high change states.

## Operating Model
- Cadence: weekly release trains with automated regression, accessibility, and compliance verification. Freeze only lifts after passing legal sign off and payment smoke tests.
- Data governance: central telemetry team owns anonymized usage metrics, redlines sensitive data, and enforces retention policy per jurisdiction.
- Documentation: every change logs architectural decisions, legal references, and QA evidence in the ops knowledge base before merge.

- Q4: Two additional markets with localized intake, partner attorney referral network, and marketplace contributor onboarding.

## Success Metrics
- Legal accuracy: flagged compliance defect tickets divided by total documents delivered per jurisdiction.

## Immediate Actions
