# 123LegalDoc Service Disclaimer

_Last updated: 2025-09-19_

123LegalDoc, Inc. ("123LegalDoc," "we," or "us") provides self-help document automation tools and related educational content. We are **not** a law firm, our employees are **not** acting as your attorney, and no attorney-client relationship is created by your use of our services. The information and documents generated through our platform are provided for general informational purposes only and are not a substitute for the advice of a licensed attorney in your jurisdiction.

## Key Principles

1. **No Legal Advice** - The platform offers standardized document workflows and educational materials. These materials do not constitute legal advice, legal opinions, or recommendations about your specific situation.
2. **No Attorney-Client Relationship** - Communications with 123LegalDoc (including chat, email, or phone interactions with our support team or AI assistants) do not create an attorney-client relationship. Do not send confidential or privileged information to us.
3. **Jurisdictional Limits** - Laws vary by jurisdiction and may change over time. Our U.S. workflows are designed for general applicability, but state-specific requirements (for example, notarization, witness, or filing obligations) may still apply. Always consult a licensed attorney in the relevant jurisdiction before relying on any generated document.
4. **Consumer Verification** - You are responsible for reviewing any generated document, verifying that it meets your needs, and ensuring timely filing, signing, notarization, and submission to the appropriate authority.
5. **Third-Party Professionals** - When requested, we may provide referrals to independent attorneys or other professionals. Such referrals are provided solely for convenience. Fees, scope of work, and representation terms must be negotiated directly with the professional.
6. **Emergency Matters** - The platform is not suitable for urgent legal matters, litigation deadlines, or situations involving imminent risk. Seek qualified legal counsel immediately for time-sensitive or emergency issues.
