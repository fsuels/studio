# Fixes Applied for Preview and Wizard Issues

## Issues Identified & Fixed

### üîß Issue 1: Preview not showing answers in PDF
**Root Cause**: Runtime audit was running before `documentConfig` was loaded, and overlay system wasn't being properly invoked.

**Fixes Applied**:
- ‚úÖ Moved runtime audit to AFTER `loadDocumentConfig` completes (StatePDFPreview.tsx:60-67)
- ‚úÖ Enhanced logging in `smartFieldMapping` function (pdf-overlay-service.ts:48)
- ‚úÖ Added form data flow verification in runtime audit

### üîß Issue 2: Wizard questions not matching PDF form fields  
**Root Cause**: Dynamic questions loading had dependency issues and wasn't falling back properly to static questions.

**Fixes Applied**:
- ‚úÖ Enhanced `loadDynamicQuestions` function with better logging (StartWizardPageClient.tsx:118-148)
- ‚úÖ Added state detection from URL parameters (`stateFromUrl`)
- ‚úÖ Improved fallback logic to static questions when dynamic loading fails
- ‚úÖ Added detailed console logging for debugging question loading flow

### üîß Issue 3: Preview space too small requiring scrolling
**Root Cause**: Fixed height of `h-[800px]` was not responsive and too small for modern displays.

**Fixes Applied**:
- ‚úÖ Changed SimplePDFViewer height to `h-[calc(100vh-12rem)] min-h-[900px]` (StatePDFPreview.tsx:227)
- ‚úÖ Increased preview container height to `h-[calc(100vh-10rem)] lg:h-[calc(100vh-6rem)]` (StartWizardPageClient.tsx:454)
- ‚úÖ Made preview responsive to viewport height while maintaining minimum usable size

## Runtime Audit Implementation

### üöë Debug Logging Added
**StatePDFPreview.tsx** (Lines 60-67):
```javascript
console.groupCollapsed('%cüöë Runtime audit','background:#333;color:#0f0;padding:2px');
console.log('docConfig.questions', fullDocConfig?.questions?.map(q => q.id));
console.log('overlay.fieldMapping keys', Object.keys(fullDocConfig?.overlayConfig?.fieldMapping ?? {}));
console.log('overlay.coordinates keys', Object.keys(fullDocConfig?.overlayConfig?.coordinates ?? {}));
console.log('formData live', formData);
console.groupEnd();
```

**pdf-overlay-service.ts** (Line 48):
```javascript
console.log('‚ñ∂Ô∏è applying fieldMapping with keys', Object.keys(mapping));
```

## Expected Results After Fixes

### ‚úÖ Preview Shows Answers
- PDF overlay system should now properly fill form fields
- Console shows "‚ñ∂Ô∏è applying fieldMapping with keys" when typing in fields
- Form data appears in PDF preview in real-time

### ‚úÖ Wizard Questions Match PDF  
- Dynamic questions load for states with official forms (FL, CO, AL, etc.)
- Question IDs match overlay fieldMapping keys exactly
- Console shows successful question loading with field IDs

### ‚úÖ Improved Preview Size
- Preview now uses most of the viewport height
- Minimum 900px height ensures readability
- No scrolling needed to see full page content

## Manual Testing Steps

1. **Navigate to**: `/en/docs/vehicle-bill-of-sale/start`
2. **Open DevTools** Console tab
3. **Select FL (Florida)** as state
4. **Watch console for**:
   - "üîÑ Loading dynamic questions for vehicle-bill-of-sale in FL"
   - "‚úÖ Loaded X dynamic questions for FL"
   - "üöë Runtime audit" group showing question/overlay alignment
5. **Type "Jane Seller"** in first field
6. **Watch console for**:
   - "‚ñ∂Ô∏è applying fieldMapping with keys"
7. **Verify**:
   - Preview shows larger, more readable PDF
   - Form data appears in PDF as you type
   - Wizard questions match PDF field labels exactly

## Next Steps
- Remove debug logging before production deployment
- Test with multiple states to verify fallback behavior
- Verify overlay system works with both AcroForm and coordinate-based PDFs
